# BNO055LITE
<h4>A library for the BNO055 made for ease of use and high configurability.</h4>
<p>To get started, just upload one of the example sketches!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently the library has suppourt for reading the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Sensor fusion reading might come soon. This library also has support for full configuration of all settings for every sensor! that means you can change the sensing range, data output rate, and power / operational mode of the gyroscope and accelerometer, and several other settings on the magnetometer!</p>
